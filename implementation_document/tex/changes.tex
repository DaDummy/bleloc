\chapter{Changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Missing methods in bleloc.client.model.utils.Encryptor \\ decryptScanResult in addition to encryptScanResult \\ Reason: this code obviously belongs to Encryptor, needs to be callable
\item Missing method isTracked method in TrackingStateManager \\ Reason: this code obviously belongs to TrackingStateManager, needs to be callable
\item Controller:
\begin{itemize}
\item Annotation, Request Filter and CDI Bean classes added
\item Annotations and annotated parameters added in request methods
\item Reason: This concept was mentioned in design document, but the required classes were not specified.
\item Return type in request methods changed to pass objects to FreeMarker templates
\item Reason: Template needs to be filled with data.
%\item ExceptionMapper added to return better status codes
\end{itemize}
\item getSalt renamed to generateRandomSalt \\ Reason: Stress new salt is generated every call. Clear naming is important especially in cryptographic code.
\item Added GeneralStore and AbstractEntry base class \\ Reason: Much more code needed than expected in design phase. Avoid code duplication.
\item Added Helper classes for ORM (like TypeConverter)
\item Stores and entities changed to meet Room's and Hibernate's expectations
\item Removed Observer as we use EventListeners
\item Implement Listeners where needed
\item Pass Contexts around \\ Reason: Most of Android APIs need Context objects
\item Added more database queries
\item Added settings
\item Removed SettingsController \\ Reason: Android's SharedPreferences does exactly the same but supports more types than Strings
\end{itemize}
