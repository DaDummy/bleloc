\subsection{Information about testing}
This document describes a testing phase of BLEloc projec - the systematic discovery and debugging of defects. The document represents the result of testing the application.The main focus was on Unit and on UI testing. Unit tests were written to verify the functionality of code at the function level. UI testing is responsible for ensuring the proper functionality of a graphical user interface (GUI) of application.
The following testing aspects are documented here further:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Code coverage of the whole project with unit tests
	\item Monkey tests by providing random inputs and checking BLEloc behavior 
	\item Hallway Usability tests  
	\item Checked test cases from Pflichtenheft
	\item Performed code changes 
	\item Founded defects and failures
