\chapter{Requirements Changes}
All mandatory functional requirements are covered by the design with class diagrams and sequence diagrams.

The following optional requirements are either covered completely, or fit into existing classes and structures
\begin{itemize}
	\item FRO-1: Displaying Locations on an OSM-Map
	\item FRO-2: User Account password change
	\item FRO-3: Backoffice Account password change
	\item FRO-4: Toggling scanning mode
	\item FRO-5: Optimizing mobile data usage
	\item FRO-7: Location data export
	\item FRO-8: Limiting the number of tracked BT-Devices
\end{itemize}

All other optional requirements have not been accounted for in this document. However, the current design allows for easy extendability to accommodate all optional requirements in the future.
